With the current implementation it takes a consistant 4127 us, that takes into account Triggering, reading the echo pin and calculating the distance

The CPU usage is the following:
Task Name       Runtime Percentage
main            2755366         1%
IDLE1           265069962               99%
IDLE0           262314621               98%
ipc1            20338           <1%
ipc0            19517           <1%

what does it mean?
the main application is using 1% of the CPU, which stays in IDLE mode 99% of the time
the ipc1 and ipc0 comes from the FreeRTOS that is in charge of syncronizing the two cores
